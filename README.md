##What is done?

Using html, css, jquery and knockoutJS library, made a map of Kochin city and some of its important landmarks with Google and Wikipedia API.
Included the Google API and a Media API  with a valid license key to incorporate the Google Map and Wikipedia links
Data requests that fail are handled **gracefully** using common fallback techniques through the browser's Alert window.
Have included option with search and Filter options and also a navigation bar for the tab and mobile.

Images are compressed and converted into png using online converter and compressor.
